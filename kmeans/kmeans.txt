k-means clustering

relocative clustering (fixed number of clusters that are reassigned iteratively)
1. Find distance between each point and each cluster center
2. Assign each point to the cluster with the closest center
3. Recalculate the cluster centers based on the points assigned to each cluster
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the cluster centers do not change significantly or max iterations reached
