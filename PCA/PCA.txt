PCA- Principal Component Analysis
Not necessarily dimensionality reduction (can be depending on PC chosen)
Finds principal components each with an explained variance of features
Reduces features while retaining highest variance data
Elbow plot: PCs vs % explained variance
PCs = # features
larger eigenvalue = more explained variance

Steps for solving:
- Standardize and center data
- Find covariance matrix 
- Eigen decomposition and find PCs
- Project data into lower dimension (eigenvector * data)

** To apply PCA, dot matrix (standardized) with eigenvectors (in matrix form) **
